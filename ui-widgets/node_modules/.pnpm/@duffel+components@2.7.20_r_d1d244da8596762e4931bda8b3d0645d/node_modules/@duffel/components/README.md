## Requirements

The Duffel component library requires **Node.js v14 (LTS)** or later.

## Usage

The Duffel component library has the following components:

- [Seat Selection](https://duffel.com/docs/guides/adding-seats#using-the-seatselection-ui-component)
- [Card Payment](https://duffel.com/docs/guides/collecting-customer-card-payments#collect-payment)
- [Additional Baggage](https://duffel.com/docs/guides/adding-extra-bags#using-the-additional-baggage-ui-component)

## Local development

Since the Duffel Components aren't an application on their own, it can be a bit tricky to test any changes locally without just publishing the package to NPM and then using the latest version in whatever application that consumes the components. Please see the [guide in Notion](https://www.notion.so/duffel/Working-with-Duffel-Components-locally-0ef56226d7ee477786e68d7308d37e00) for how to use a local version of the Duffel Components package in your local repositories for testing.
